To completely remove Jenkins from your system on Windows, follow these steps:

Step 1: Stop and Uninstall Jenkins Service
        Open Services:
        
        Press Win + R, type services.msc, and press Enter.
        Find Jenkins in the list, right-click on it, and select Stop.
        Remove the Jenkins Service:
        
        Open a command prompt with administrator privileges.
        Run the following command to remove the Jenkins service:

        sc delete jenkins

Step 2: Uninstall Jenkins from Control Panel
        Open Control Panel.

        Go to Programs > Programs and Features.

        If you see Jenkins in the list, right-click on it and select Uninstall.

Step 3: Delete Jenkins Directories and Files
        Delete Jenkins Installation Directory:
        By default, this is usually located at C:\Program Files\Jenkins or C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins.
        Delete Jenkins Home Directory:
        The home directory typically stores all Jenkins configurations, jobs, and plugins. Itâ€™s usually located at:
        C:\ProgramData\Jenkins (for default installations)
        If you changed the JENKINS_HOME environment variable to a custom path, delete that custom path instead.
